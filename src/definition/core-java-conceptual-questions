Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
=Programing language is a set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer to perform a tusk.
What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
=There are three main components of Java - JVM, JDK, and JRE. JDK or Java Development Kit is
where the developers write their code and run it through the JRE or Java Runtime Environment.
through the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) it says how the code translated.
What is IDE?
=An integrated development environment (IDE) is software for building applications
What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
=Eclipse, Apache NetBeans,IntelliJ IDE
Explain the entire java life cycle.
=There are 3 main stage of java life cycle....
1.Editing the program--First, typing the program in a text editor then we have to save the code
with a java execution.
2.compiling the source code--the second step is compilation. The output of the compiler
will be machine independent Thats called byte code.
3.Executing the byte code--Last step is execution. The bytecode generated by the compiler
will be executed by Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
what is class?
= A class is a blueprint that defines the variables and the methods common to all objects
of a certain kind.
What is object?
=Object is a member of java class. Each Object has its identity, behavior and state.
What is the entry point of an application
=The main Method
Why main is static?
=So that compiler can call it without the creation of an object or before the creation
of an object of the class
Which class is the superclass of all classes?
=Object class
What is difference between path and classpath variables?
=path variable is used to set the path for all Java software tools ,classpath variable is used
to set the path for java classes.
What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
= An abstract class allows you to create functionality that subclasses can implement or override.
An interface only allows you to define functionality, not implement it.
Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
what is Access Specifier?
=An access specifier is a defining code element that can determine which elements of a program are
allowed to access a specific variable or other piece of data.
What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
=OOP concepts in Java are the main ideas behind Java's Object Oriented Programming. They are an abstraction,
encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
=Java package is a namespace that organized a set of related class and interface.
=Java.lang package is imported by default.
What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
=API stands for Application Programming Interface that allows two application to talk each other.
Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
=No, java Doesn't support multiple inheritance , because it can't extends more then one class.
What is method overloading and when it happens?
=Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.
Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
=The try-catch is the simplest method of handling exceptions. Put the code you want to run
in the try block, and any Java exceptions that the code throws are caught by one or more catch
blocks. This method will catch any type of Java exceptions that get thrown.
This is the simplest mechanism for handling exceptions.
What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
=In Java, static keyword is mainly used for memory management. It can be used with variables,
methods, blocks and nested classes. It is a keyword which is used to share the same variable
or method of a given class. Basically, static is used for a constant variable or a method
that is same for every instance of a class.
What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
=In Java, the final keyword can be used while declaring an entity. Using the final keyword
means that the value can't be modified in the future.
What is final, finally and finalize?
=The final, finally, and finalize are keywords in Java that are used in exception handling.
The basic difference between final, finally and finalize is that the final is an access modifier,
finally is the block in Exception Handling and finalize is the method of object class.
What is constructor
=A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called
when an object of a class is created.
Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
=A class can have multiple constructors that differ in the number and/or type of their parameters
If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
=It's called the default constructor.
What is "this" keyword in java ?
="this" keyword is used to access method of current class as it has reference of current class.
What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
="supper" keyword represent the current instance of parent class
What is JVM stand for ?
=A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs.
Is JVM platform independent?
= JVM is platform-dependent. Different JVM is designed for different OS and byte code is able
to run on different OS
What version of java are you using?
="11.0.12"
What is JAR stand for
=JAR stands for Java ARchive. It's a file format based on the popular ZIP file format
and is used for aggregating many files into one.
What is the difference between JDK & JVM?
=JDK is a software bundle which provides Java class libraries with necessary component
to run Java code. JVM executes Java byte code and provides an environment for executing it
What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
=The JVM is the process that runs the Java code, and the JRE are all files distributed to form
the "environment" in which the JVM runs
What is compile time and run time?
=Compile time is the period when the programming code is converted to the machine code . Runtime is the
period of time when a program is running and generally occurs after compile time.
What is heap?
= A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.
How java manage it's memory?
= Java does memory management automatically. Java uses an automatic memory management system
called a garbage collector.
What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
=String is immutable whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable classes.
StringBuffer is thread-safe and synchronized whereas StringBuilder is not
What is Singleton class?
= a singleton class is a class that can have only one object  at a time.
What is Serialization and Deserialization?
=Serialization is the process of converting some in-memory object to another format that
could be used to either store in a file or sent over the network. Deserialization is the
inverse process meaning the actual object instance is restored from the given serialized
representation of the object.
when to use transient variable in java?
=transient is a variables modifier used in serialization. At the time of serialization, if we
don't want to save value of a particular variable in a file, then we use transient keyword.
Difference between while and do..while loop?
=while loop check condition before iteration of the loop. On the other hand, the do-while loop
verifies the condition after the execution of the statements inside the loop.
What is Enum?
= An enum is a data type that contains fixed set of constants.
What is Iterator
=An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections
Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
=Integer take more memory.
Why is String Immutable in Java?
=The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency,
caching, and class loading. The reason of making string final is to destroy the immutability
and to not allow others to extend it. The String objects are cached in the String pool, and
it makes the String immutable.
What is constructor chaining in Java?
=Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor
with respect to current object.
The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
= The primary difference between the serial and parallel collectors is that the parallel
collector has multiple threads that are used to speed up garbage collection.
What is JIT stands for?
=The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is a component of the runtime environment that improves the
performance of Java applications by compiling bytecodes to native machine code at run time.
Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
=Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up
and may increase or decrease in size while the application runs. When the heap becomes full,
garbage is collected. During the garbage collection objects that are no longer used are cleared,
thus making space for new objects.
Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
what is multithreading in java?
What is the use of synchronization in Java?
What is Framework?
=java frameworks are specific to the Java programming language. It's a Java platform for
developing software applications and Java programs.
What are the testing Framework available in java?
Difference between jUnit and testNG?
What are the dependencies for this project?
what is dependency injection in java?
What is static binding and dynamic binding?
